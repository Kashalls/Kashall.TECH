After almost continuous revisions, I've finally got my personal website to a state where I am proud of it. It's been a long journey since I first got invested in Vue and honestly I am not ready to migrate to Vue 3. As it is still pretty new, and the fact that renovate says its only a 30% migration rate, I don't feel comfort moving until Nuxt 3 comes out of RC.
